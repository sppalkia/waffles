waffles
=======
Waffles was an iPad application that would allow a user to search for LEGO sets and retrieve instruction manuals.
Unfortunately, the API Waffles used (www.brickset.com) no longer exists. The  code still has a few good examples
involving XML parsing and a couple other things, so hopefully someone finds it useful.
